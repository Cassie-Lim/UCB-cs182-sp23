If you are talking about dot product. I think the two forms are equivalent.

We have 

vec(uncle)-vec(aunt)=\ vec(man)-\ vec(woman)

which indicates 

\left(vec(uncle)-vec(aunt)\right)^T@\left(vec(uncle)-vec(aunt)\right)

= \left(vec(man)-\ vec(woman)\right)^T\left(vec(man)-\ vec(woman)\right)

In most of the cases, the embedded vector is normalized to a unit vector. We then have

vec\left(uncle\right)^T@vec\left(aunt\right)=\ vec\left(man\right)^T@vec\left(woman\right)
